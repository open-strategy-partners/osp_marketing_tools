# Phases

Our editing process is divided into phases. We move from the largest scope (structure) to the smallest, (choice of words). 

* **Scope & Narrative Structure:** Your piece should have a thesis and the subsequent narrative should follow a logical progression proving it.
* **Flow & Readability:** Assess how the content flows and transitions between sections. Include visual cues (lists, headers, etc.) to help the reader move through the narrative easily. 
* **Style & Phrasing** Make sure you’re writing engaging content appropriate for the brand and target audience.
* **Choice of Words** Scan the choice of specific words for appropriate emotional tone, proper grammar, and accurate terminology. 

When editing someone else’s work, you can and will skip back and forth between phases, but they give us a strong logical framework to help us be kind, consistent, and helpful editors.

## The Brief and the Positivity Pass

The first step for an editor doesn't involve writing, but rather, reading. Creative briefs live at the top of every written piece OSP creates, and they make the scope explicitly clear to the editor (or clients, or anyone else!). 

After the editor scans the brief, the second step is to conduct the "[Positivity Pass](positivity-pass.md)." This is when you read the content through in its entirety, and you make note of the pieces that are particularly well written and that really nail the brief.
